## About

This academic project aims to provide a comprehensive open-source solution for cybersecurity operations, with the objective of making advanced security tools accessible to a wider audience. All components used in this project are open-source and free.
## Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to build a fully functional Security Operations Center (SOC) using open-source tools, all containerized for one-click deployment. Leveraging Docker, the SOC can be seamlessly deployed across diverse environments, ensuring portability and ease of use.

## Installation

To install the SOC follow the Installation Guide [here](https://github.com/DorraJL/Soc-Project/blob/959381070c241f494ccb8680cb04671a364e3f57/SOC%20Implementation%20Guide/README.md)

## What is a SOC?

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized unit responsible for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. It serves as the nerve center for an organizationâ€™s cybersecurity, combining people, processes, and technology to protect digital assets. SOC teams use various tools and techniques to continuously monitor networks, systems, and applications, playing a key role in mitigating and resolving security threats.
